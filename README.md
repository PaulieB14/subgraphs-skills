A collection of AI agent skills providing expert knowledge for developing, testing, and deploying subgraphs with [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) protocol.

## Overview

This repository provides subgraph development expertise for AI coding assistants in **two formats**:

| Format | Location | Use With |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Claude Code Plugin** | `skills/` | Claude Code CLI |
| **OpenClaw Skills** | `openclaw/` | OpenClaw / Clawdbot |

Same knowledge, different agent platforms.

## Skills

### 🛠️ subgraph-dev
Core development knowledge including:
- Schema design and GraphQL types
- Manifest configuration (subgraph.yaml)
- AssemblyScript mapping handlers
- Data source templates
- Contract bindings and calls
- **Subgraph Composition** - Combine multiple subgraphs
- **Common Patterns** - ERC20, DEX, NFT, Lending, Staking, Governance
- Subgraph Uncrashable (safe code generation)
- Deployment workflows

### ⚡ subgraph-optimization
Performance best practices from The Graph docs:
- Pruning with indexerHints
- Arrays with @derivedFrom
- Immutable entities and Bytes as IDs
- Avoiding eth_calls
- Timeseries and aggregations
- Grafting for hotfixes

### 🧪 subgraph-testing
Quality assurance with Matchstick and Subgraph Linter:
- **Subgraph Linter** - Static analysis to catch bugs before runtime
- **Common Errors** - Troubleshooting guide for indexing issues
- Unit testing setup and patterns with Matchstick
- Mock events and contract calls
- Entity assertions
- Data source mocking
- CI/CD integration

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
# Add as a Claude Code plugin
claude plugins add PaulieB14/subgraphs-skills
```

### OpenClaw / Clawdbot

```bash
# Copy skills to OpenClaw directory
cp -r openclaw/subgraph-* ~/.openclaw/skills/

# Or via ClawHub (when published)
clawdbot skill install subgraph-dev
clawdbot skill install subgraph-optimization
clawdbot skill install subgraph-testing
```

### Manual

Clone this repository and reference it in your agent's configuration.

## Usage Examples

Once installed, the AI assistant will have access to subgraph development expertise:

**Schema Design:**
> "Create a schema for tracking DEX swaps with proper relationships"

**Optimization:**
> "How do I optimize my subgraph for faster indexing?"

**Testing:**
> "Write unit tests for my Transfer event handler"
